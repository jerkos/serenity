During my experiences, I had the opportunity to work with a variety of programming languages,
each with its own unique features and syntax. When transitioning between languages,
it can be tempting to try to mimic the behavior of one language in another, especially when
you are satisifed of the expressiveness or readability of the former.

## Java options missing in Python

During my time working with Java, I grew accustomed to the strict typing and object-oriented
paradigm of the language. Both Java and Python have a `null` value. To reduce the risk of
null pointer exceptions, Java introduced the `Optional` class, which allows developers to
explicitly handle the presence or absence of a value. When I started working with Python,
I found myself missing the `Optional` class and tried to mimic its behavior.

And start to enter to functional programming concepts (functor, monad, monoid)...But it is
another story.

That's why I created my own <a href="https://github.com/jerkos/fateful">library</a> in Python
to wrap my `maybe`null / None values.

```python
from fateful import opt, Null, Some

opt('value').or_('new value')
opt('value').or_else(lambda: 'another value')
Null.or_else(lambda: 'new value')
opt(None).get() # same as Null.get() -> raise ValueError

```

However, I soon realized that I missed a try catch block... That's why I implemented my own.
And a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)">monads</a>
from functional programming languages such as Haskell.

```python
def may_fail(x: int) -> float:
    return 1 / x

from fateful.monad.resut import sync_try

r: Ok[float] | Err[ZeroDivisionError] = sync_try(may_fail, ZeroDivisionError)(1)
result = sync_try(may_fail, ZeroDivisionError)(1).or_(10.0)

assert result == 1.0

result = sync_try(may_fail, ZeroDivisonError)(0).or_(10.0)
assert result == 10.0
```

And using `asyncio` to handle asynchronous code...

```python
async def divide_async(a, b):
    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
    return a / b

from fateful.monad import async_try

value = await async_try(add_async)( 1, 1).or_else(lambda: 4)
```

Latter I finally found many `functional`libraries that already implemented this kind of feature.
- <a href="https://github.com/jasondelaat/pymonad">PyMonad</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/EntilZha/PyFunctional">PyFunctional</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/kachayev/fn.py">fn</a>
- and many others...(forgot the most famous one with lot of container available)

After being happy with the result, I wondered if I broke the famous Zen of Python, notably the
`explicit is better than implicit` and `simple is better than complex` principles.

Personnally, when you are familiar with all the features, the code becomes more readable and
maintainable:
- less indentation
- less `try catch block`
- less `if else`

But my colleagues did not think that way...I tried to explain them the benefits of using this kind
of library, but they were not convinced. So everything was removed and I had to adapt to the
Python way of doing things.


## Conclusion

So even if it might be tempting to mimic the behavior of other languages in Python, it is
important to remember that each language has its own unique features and paradigms. While
it can be beneficial to borrow ideas from other languages, it is important to consider
if the feature you are borrowing is well understood by your team and if it aligns with
the idiomatic way of doing things in Python.

## Oops, I did it again, with goroutines...

Goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime. It is a function that is capable of
running concurrently with other functions. Channels are used to synchronize goroutines and
communicate between them in relatively easy manner.

 I tried to mimic this behavior in Python by using the `async` module, just, you known to see...
Do not ask me really why !

Here is the <a href="https://gist.github.com/jerkos/9f5e3e7ddc8b890c8a7eb3861c9759be">gist</a> of the python implementation.


```python
async def test_channel_range():
    ch: Channel[int] = make_chan()

    async def f():
        for i in range(4):
            await asyncio.sleep(i / 10)
            await (ch << i * i)
        await ch.close()

    go(f)()

    with ch:
        # non blocking iteration with default function execution
        for v in ch:
            r = await select(
                case(v),
                default(lambda: print("Running when not ready yet"),
            )
            print(r)
```
